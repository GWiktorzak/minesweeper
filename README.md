# minesweeper
Background
Based on the classic game, Minesweeper. I tried to recreate the gamend.

Objective
The board is divided into squares. There may be a mine behind it or not. Your goal to open/sweep all tiles with no mine on them. If you click on a mine you lose. If you open all other tiles, you win.

When you left-click on a square with no mine, it will show how many mines are surrounding that square; use this to help you. If that number is none, the square will cascade and open up adjacent tiles with no surrounding mines.

You can also right-click tiles to flag them as an indicator to yourself that you think there is a mine there. At the start of the game, you are given as many flags as there are mines. The top-left counter is your flags left.

Click the face emoji twice to restart the game.
